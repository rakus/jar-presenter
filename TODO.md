Prime Directives:
* No dependencies! JDK classes only.
* As less code as possible.
* "Nice to have" is no reason

* Only allow clients from localhost
* Simple hand made command line handling
* Commands to implement:
    * `serve` to start the HTTP server (default)
        * option to not start browser
        * option to name browser to start
        * option to allow connect from everywhere
    * `extract` to extract the presentation from the jar
    * `build` to create a new jar-presentation jar.
