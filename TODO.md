Prime Directives:
* No dependencies! JDK classes only.
* As less code as possible.
* "Nice to have" is no reason

* Only allow clients from localhost
* Commands to implement:
    * `build` to create a new jar-presentation jar.

* Expand content type detection. Maybe also look into the first bytes to transfer.
* prevent '../' attacks
